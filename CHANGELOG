v1.4.0
  - touistc:
    - (internal) merged exp and clause types for less code redundancy
v1.3.1
  - touistc:
    - fixed `a (b)` recognized as `a(b)` instead of `a and b`
    - added --debug-formula-expansion which prints the "expanded" version
      of bigand, bigor, exact and numerical expressions; helps for debugging
      complex formulas!
  - gui:
    - select the system language automatically
	- fix "export" button not working
	- export and import are now use the operating system UI (jre>=1.7)
	- jre>=1.7 is now required; it solves the wierd mac problem that says
	  that you need to install the JDK for using command-line functions
v1.3.0
  - touist.jar:
    - fix touist hanging on "solve" on some unsatisfiable formulas
    - fix subset(.,.) construct not displayed in latex display
  - touistc:
    - now possible to have empty sets or formula block
    - added message when using a undeclared $var
    - added message when using a set instead of a term
    - added message when using a variable that doesn't have
      the expected content
    - revamped syntax errors, with multi-lines errors and precise position
      Note that many syntax errors still lack a proper message; some error
      messages still you can help us improve these messages in
      parser.messages file.
    - added <=> symbol that had been forgotten at some point
    - fixed bug with `not((p => p) => (q => q))` that should be
      unsat; it was related to CNF expansion happening in inner -> outer
      instead of outer -> inner

    - added --debug-syntax option for debugging parser.messages messages
v1.2.0
