# This Travis-ci configuration file has been writen to automate
# the building process and make deploying the application easy.
# for the platforms Linux and Mac OS X.
#
# The travis-ci servers are going to run this script on any push
# to the repo. Basically, it
# - tells the author of a commit if his commit has broken the build,
# - deploys two .zip containing the linux and osx apps, with the
#   touist compiled in it
#
# To allow Travis-ci to know that something has been pushed to the repo
# the owner of the project (Olivier Lezaud back then) had had to link
# the repo to the Travis-ci website.
