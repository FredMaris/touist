The solver for the Touist language

The Touist language is a friendly language for writing propositional
logic (SAT), logic on real and integers (SMT) and quantified boolean
formulas (QBF). This language aims to formalize real-life problems
(e.g., the sudoku can be solved in a few lines). Touist embeds a SAT
solver (minisat) and can be built with optionnal SMT and QBF solvers.
Touist is also able to generate the latex, DIMACS, SMT-LIB and QDIMACS
formats from a touist file.

Optionnal solvers:
- for using Yices2 (--smt --solve), run `opam install yices2`
- for using Quantor (--qbf --solve), run `opam install qbf`
- for using Depqbf (--qbf --solve --depqbf), it's less easy;
  (1) install depqbf (brew install depqbf); on ubuntu, depqbf package does
      not contain libqdpll.a, so you might have to download+compile+install
  (2) download ocaml-qbf; uninstall the opam version (opam uninstall qbf)
  (3) ./configure --enable-depqbf && make && make install
  (4) opam reinstall touist
