(*
 * dimacs.ml: processes the CNF-compliant version of the abstract syntaxic tree and
 *            produces a string in DIMACS format.
 *            [to_dimacs] is the main function.

 * Project TouIST, 2015. Easily formalize and solve real-world sized problems
 * using propositional logic and linear theory of reals with a nice language and GUI.
