(* 1. Prevent current model from reappearing
   =========================================
   We must prevent the current model to reappear in future models;
   to do so, we add a clause that take the negation of the valuations
   E.g: with the model a=1, b=0 we must add the clause -a or b.
   [counter_clause] will produce a list of literals that corresponds
   to this clause.
   IMPORTANT: When adding the counter-clause, the problem can become unsat.
   [next_model] returns false if the added clause makes the formula unsat. *)

(* 2. Avoid duplicates caused by fake literals (of the form '&6')
   ==============================================================
   Our issue here: the models contain fake '&12' literals. We don't
   want to see these fake literals in our models; we also want to
   remove the duplicate models linked to these fake literals.
   To avoid those duplicates, we store the models (without the fake
   literals) in a set.

   To use this function, you need a ModelSet ref already initialized, e.g. with
    let models = ref ModelSet.empty *)

let equivalent_models set1 set2 = ModelSet.equal set1 set2

(* 1. Fetch the models
   ===================
   This is done calling multiple times [fetch_model]. If the first call
   returns false, it means that this problem is unsat. If the second call
   (or any subsequent call) returns false, there is no more models.
   The general structure of the model fetching must be:
      fetch_model -> next_model -> fetch_model -> next_model -> fetch_model...
