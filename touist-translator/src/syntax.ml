  (* UnexpProp is a proposition that contains unexpandable variables; we cannot
     tranform UnexpProp into Prop before knowing what is the content of the
     variables. Examples:
         abcd(1,$d,$i,a)       <- not a full-string yet
     Prop contains the actual proposition after the evaluation has been run.
     Example: if $d=foo and $i=123, then Prop is:
         abcd(1,foo,123,a)     <- an actual string that represents an actual
                                  logical proposition

  | Loc              of ast * Msg.loc  
  (* Loc is a clever way of keeping the locations in the text of the ast elements.
     In parser.mly, each production rule gives its location in the original text;
     for example, instead of simply returning
         Inter (x,y)
     the parser will return
         Loc (Inter (x,y), ($startpos,$endpos))
     Loc is used in eval.ml when checking the types; it allows to give precise
     locations.
