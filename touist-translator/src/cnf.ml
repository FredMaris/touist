(*  Vocabulary:
    - Literal:
      a possibly negated proposition; we denote them as a, b... and
      their type is homogenous to Term _ or Not(Term _) or Top or Bottom. Exples:
          a                                         is a literal
          not b                                     is a literal
    - Clause:
      a disjunction (= separated by "or") of possibly negated literals.
      Example of clause:
          a or not b or c or d                      is a clause
      WARNING: Syntax.exp isn't actually a clause as defined here; it can
      hold Implies, Equiv, Xor. Its naming isn't really appropriate...
    - Conjunction:
      literals separated by "and"; example:
          a and b and not and not d                 is a conjunction
    - AST:
      abstract syntax tree; it is homogenous to Syntax.exp
      and is a recursive tree representing a formula, using Or, And, Implies...
      Example: the formula (1) has the abstract syntax tree (2):
          (a or b) and not c                          (1) natural language
          And (Or (Term a, Term b),Not (Term c))   (2) abstract syntax tree
    - CNF:
      a Conjunctive Normal Form is an AST that has a special structure with
      is a conjunction of disjunctions of literals. For example:
          (a or not b) and (not c and d)            is a CNF form
          (a and b) or not (c or d)                 is not a CNF form
 *)

(* [is_clause] checks that the given AST is a clause. This function can only
   be called on an AST containing Or, And or Not. No Equiv or Implies! *)
let rec is_clause (ast: exp) : bool = match ast with
  | Top | Bottom | Term _ | Not (Term _) -> true
  | And _ -> false
  | Or (x,y) -> is_clause x && is_clause y
  | x -> failwith ("is_clause: unexpected value " ^ (string_of_exp x))

(* [push_lit] allows to translate into CNF the non-CNF disjunction `d or cnf`
   (`d` is the literal we want to add, `cnf` is the existing CNF form).
   For example:
          d  or  ((a or not b) and (not c))            <- is not in CNF
    <=>   push_lit (d) ((a or not b) and not c)
    <=>   (d or a or b) and (d or not c)               <- is in CNF
    This function is necessary because `d or cnf` (with `cnf` an arbitrary CNF
    form) is not a CNF form and must be modified. Conversely, the form
          `d  and  ((a or not b) and (not c))`
    doesn't need to be modified because it is already in CNF.  *)

  | And (x,y)    -> And (push_lit lit x, push_lit lit y)
  | Or (x,y)     -> Or (lit, Or (x,y))
  | x -> failwith ("Cnf.push_lit: unexpected " ^ (string_of_exp x))


(* [genterm] generates a (Term &i) with i being a self-incrementing index.
 * This function allows to speed up and simplify the translation of some
 * forms of Or.
 * NOTE: OCaml's functions can't have 0 param: we use the unit `()`. *)

(* `strop` is a type is used in [to_cnf] in order to stop it after a number of
   recursions. See (1) below *)
type stop = No | Yes of int

(* [to_cnf] translates the syntaxic tree made of Or, And, Implies, Equiv...
 * Or, And and Not; moreover, it can only be in a conjunction of clauses
 * (see a reminder of their definition above).
 * For example (instead of And, Or we use "and" and "or" and "not"):
 *     (a or not b or c) and (not a or b or d) and (d)
 * The matching abstract syntax tree (ast) is
 *     And (Or a,(Cor (Not b),c)), (And (Or (Or (Not a),b),d), d)
 *
 * The `depth` variable tells what is the current level of recursion and
 * helps for debugging the translation to CNF.
 * The `stop` boolean tells to_cnf if it should stop or continue the recursion
 *
 * (1) When transforming to CNF, we want to make sure that "outer" to_cnf
 *     transformations are made before inner ones. For example, in
 *          to_cnf (Not (to_cnf ((a and b) => c)))
 *     we want to limit the inner `to_cnf` expansion to let the possibily for
 *     the outer to_cnf to "simplify" with the Not as soon as possible.
 *     For inner `to_cnf`, we simply use `to_cnf_once` to prevent the inner
 *     `to_cnf` from recursing more than once.

           created by [genterm], denoted by &1, &2... and use the Tseytin
