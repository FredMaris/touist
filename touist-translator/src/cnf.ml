(*  Vocabulary:
    - Literal:
      a possibly negated proposition; we denote them as a, b... and
      their type is homogenous to Term _ or CNot(Term _) or Top or Bottom. Exples:
          a                                         is a literal
          not b                                     is a literal
    - Clause:
      a disjunction (= separated by "or") of possibly negated literals.
      Example of clause:
          a or not b or c or d                      is a clause
      WARNING: Syntax.clause isn't actually a clause as defined here; it can
      hold CImplies, CEquiv, CXor. Its naming isn't really appropriate...
    - Conjunction:
      literals separated by "and"; example:
          a and b and not and not d                 is a conjunction
    - AST:
      abstract syntax tree; it is homogenous to Syntax.clause
      and is a recursive tree representing a formula, using COr, CAnd, CImplies...
      Example: the formula (1) has the abstract syntax tree (2):
          (a or b) and not c                          (1) natural language
          CAnd (COr (Term a, Term b),CNot (Term c))   (2) abstract syntax tree
    - CNF:
      a Conjunctive Normal Form is an AST that has a special structure with
      is a conjunction of disjunctions of literals. For example:
          (a or not b) and (not c and d)            is a CNF form
          (a and b) or not (c or d)                 is not a CNF form
 *)

(* [is_clause] checks that the given AST is a clause. This function can only
   be called on an AST containing COr, CAnd or CNot. No CEquiv or CImplies! *)
let rec is_clause (ast: clause) : bool = match ast with
  | Top | Bottom | Term _ | CNot (Term _) -> true
  | CAnd _ -> false
  | COr (x,y) -> is_clause x && is_clause y
  | x -> failwith ("is_clause: unexpected value " ^ (string_of_clause x))

(* [push_lit] allows to translate into CNF the non-CNF disjunction `d or cnf`
   (`d` is the literal we want to add, `cnf` is the existing CNF form).
   For example:
          d  or  ((a or not b) and (not c))            <- is not in CNF
    <=>   push_lit (d) ((a or not b) and not c)
    <=>   (d or a or b) and (d or not c)               <- is in CNF
    This function is necessary because `d or cnf` (with `cnf` an arbitrary CNF
    form) is not a CNF form and must be modified. Conversely, the form
          `d  and  ((a or not b) and (not c))`
    doesn't need to be modified because it is already in CNF.  *)

  | COr (x,y)     -> COr (lit, COr (x,y))
  | x -> failwith ("Cnf.push_lit: unexpected " ^ (string_of_clause x))


(* [genterm] generates a (Term &i) with i being a self-incrementing index.
 * This function allows to speed up and simplify the translation of some
 * forms of COr.
 * NOTE: OCaml's functions can't have 0 param: we use the unit `()`. *)

(* `strop` is a type is used in [to_cnf] in order to stop it after a number of
   recursions. See (1) below *)
type stop = No | Yes of int

(* [to_cnf] translates the syntaxic tree made of COr, CAnd, CImplies, CEquiv...
 * COr, CAnd and CNot; moreover, it can only be in a conjunction of clauses
 * (see a reminder of their definition above).
 * For example (instead of CAnd, COr we use "and" and "or" and "not"):
 *     (a or not b or c) and (not a or b or d) and (d)
 * The matching abstract syntax tree (ast) is
 *     CAnd (COr a,(Cor (CNot b),c)), (CAnd (COr (COr (CNot a),b),d), d)
 *
 * The `depth` variable tells what is the current level of recursion and
 * helps for debugging the translation to CNF.
 * The `stop` boolean tells to_cnf if it should stop or continue the recursion
 *
 * (1) When transforming to CNF, we want to make sure that "outer" to_cnf
 *     transformations are made before inner ones. For example, in
 *          to_cnf (CNot (to_cnf ((a and b) => c)))
 *     we want to limit the inner `to_cnf` expansion to let the possibily for
 *     the outer to_cnf to "simplify" with the CNot as soon as possible.
 *     For inner `to_cnf`, we simply use `to_cnf_once` to prevent the inner
 *     `to_cnf` from recursing more than once.
